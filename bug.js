This React Native code uses AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data. However, it fails to handle potential errors during the asynchronous operations, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.  Specifically, it doesn't check for `null` values before attempting to access properties of the retrieved object.  Additionally, it uses `await` outside an `async` function.
